## Custom design, hand written code

Restaurant site made for a school assignment, during first semester of front end / web dev education. Built with HTML, CSS and JS, featuring dynamic content and interactivity. 

## Features: 

- Responsive design
- Menu section with dishes read from JSON, categorized and processed with JavaScript
- Order function: Cart with cost calculation and functionality to remove items 
- W3 validated with no errors
- Lunch offer depending on day of the week

## Main personal takeaway:

With increasing complexity in the code, I have learned the importance of implementing a clear structure from the very beginning. In my upcoming projects, I will take care to plan for modularity beforehand. That, I have learned, is not well suited for an afterthought.
